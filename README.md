# My first attempt at coding a software synthesizer

This was a project designed to explore different ideas in software synthesis and audio DSP. 

I am no longer working on this project (although I am currently developing several other
audio synthesis and sampling pluing), but I am keeping this on GitHub for reference until
I can replace it with something better.

Some of my other plugins I am keeping private for now because I plan to turn them into commercial
products in the future.
